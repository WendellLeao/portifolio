            <p>
                I've been working as a professional game developer for over two years using the Unity3D graphics engine and the C# programming language. 
                I'm currently working on a team of Brazilian developers working as a Netcode programmer on the game Rogue Masters. In addition to this project, 
                I've been working alone on a cooperative horror game for up to 4 people.

                        That's the project I'm currently working on. I work mainly as a network programmer, 
                        I took care of the synchronization of the game mechanics and the development and 
                        optimization of the game infrastructure.

                        This project I developed myself, did all the programming of the game and used ready-made assets
